Graceful handling of guest users.
1) ask for a username and live check the availability of the username
2) let the users to play the game but show a general warning/notification to set a password to complete their profile.
3) when users try to make a comment/follow/reply to other players ask to provide an email address and make them validate the email before they can do anything.
4) one profile per email
5) ask to complete the profile and simultaneously give them rewards for doing so. Like linking with facebook, twitter and google +
6) when a social profile is already associated with another acc then ask to provide another social acc or ask them which one to keep and which profile to destroy.
7) all deletion should be soft delete including comments to profiles to profile unfollow etc.
8) share option for every single achievement/badges to social platform
